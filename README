link to the github repositry with the full implementation of UDP: 

https://github.com/mamgad/RUDPy

we chose UDP to TCP in prevision of very crowded situtation. 


we managed: 
    - creating the TCP server. We used code i created for the RIO203 project
      it is not as detailled as the final code by it will be easier for me to
      build from there. 
    
    - started the creation of the object cars: we defined the random lane arri
      val and exit selection. 

TODO: 
    - on the server side --> implement the function that will collect the info 
      provided by the cars and forward it to the right vehicle
      how does the acces point will request the info ?

    - on the client side --> modelisation of the cars' delay (normal distribution). 
      The lecturer mentionned CAM message so the object message that is created in
      the file cars.py devra respecter cette architecture de message.
